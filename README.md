This is my Public Portfolio



This repository contains my personal GitHub Pages website created using Quarto.

The site was developed as part of Module 0 of the Cloud Data course. It demonstrates basic Git, GitHub, SSH configuration, and GitHub Pages deployment.

The website includes:
- A homepage (index.qmd)
- An About page (about.qmd)
- Custom styling (styles.css)
- Automated publishing to the gh-pages branch

The site is publicly available at:
